# RandomFiberLaser
simulations of random distributed feedback fiber lasers 


## FBG array

* **FBGarray.m**: the main program of FBG array simulations

* **transmission_matrix.m**: the function of transmission matrix for FBG array simulation


## FBG reflection spectrum

* **MOIreader.m**: the program that reads .txt file saved by *Micron Optics* optical sensing interrogator


## laser output

* **laserSpectrum**: the model of erbium-doped random fiber ring laser based on [the Giles's model](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/65886/)


## laser linewidth

* **linewidth.m**: the model of *DSHI* method for laser linewidth measurement, which shows the effect of delayed fiber length on the measurement of laser linewidth (lorenz)
